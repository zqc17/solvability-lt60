# Solvability-Lt60

Solvability of group of order less than 60 is proved at [OrderLt60.lean](SolvabilityLt60/OrderLt60.lean).

Most cases can be verified by the following criteria:
1. p-group is solvable.
2. Group of order $pq$ is solvable.
3. Group of order $2p^n$ is solvable.
4. Group of order $p^2q$ where $p^2 < q$ is solvable.

Special cases are: 12, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 56.
Remarkably, 30 and 56 are the most difficult cases.
